# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-23

Patch release bumping the harness6 plugin version to 0.3.3.

### Changed

- **Plugin version bump** — `plugins/harness6` manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`), `hooks/validate.py` `EXPECTED_VERSION`, and the marketplace
  plugin entry bumped to `0.3.3`. No functional behaviour change.
- **harness6-init setup** — selects Docker or Podman interactively when both are installed,
  starts Compose with explicit environment and Compose file arguments, safely registers the
  repository MCP configuration at user or project scope, and guides explicit Milvus and embedding
  provider configuration through `memsearch-init`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-09

Patch release for the harness6-init setup workflow.

### Changed

- Added runtime selection, safe MCP registration, and memsearch setup guidance to harness6-init.

### Removed

- Removed the obsolete `graphsearch`, `awsctx`, `sentry-cli`, `multi-task`, and `standup` skills and their supporting files.


All notable changes to the `harness6` plugin.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-09

Patch release removing provider-specific model assumptions from the
`design-session` skill.

### Changed

- **Model-agnostic design session** — removed vendor-specific model-switching
  instructions while preserving the design workflow.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-09

Renames the plugin from `harness5` to `harness6` to align with the
repository name (`dzungtr/harness6`) and the `harness6` branding already
used throughout the repo and ADRs. This is a **breaking change**: the
plugin install name changes from `harness5` to `harness6`.

### Changed

- **Plugin rename** — `plugins/harness5/` renamed to `plugins/harness6/`.
  All manifest names, marketplace entries, skill names, env vars, hooks,
  references, tests, and documentation updated to `harness6`.
- **Skill rename** — `harness5-init` → `harness6-init`. The
  `HARNESS5_PLUGIN_ROOT` env var is now `HARNESS6_PLUGIN_ROOT`.
- **Hook env var** — `HARNESS5_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` →
  `HARNESS6_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE`. The loader stderr prefix changed from
  `harness5:` to `harness6:`.
- **References file** — `hooks/references/harness5.md` →
  `hooks/references/harness6.md`. Title updated from "Harness 5" to
  "Harness 6".
- **Self-check** — `harness5-md-present` check renamed to
  `harness6-md-present`; `EXPECTED_VERSION` bumped to `0.3.0`.
- **Version bump** — `0.2.2` → `0.3.0` (minor; breaking).

### Breaking

- `claude plugin install harness5` no longer works — use `claude plugin
  install harness6`.
- `codex plugin install harness5` no longer works — use `codex plugin
  install harness6`.
- Users who set `HARNESS5_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` or `HARNESS5_PLUGIN_ROOT`
  must update to the `HARNESS6_` prefix.

### Notes

- Historical ADRs (`0005-harness5-plugin-distribution.md`,
  `0007-multi-plugin-layout.md`) are left unchanged — they are historical
  decision records and accurately describe the state at the time they were
  written.
- Previous `[0.2.x]` changelog entries are preserved as-is; they describe
  releases of the plugin when it was named `harness5`.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-25

Patch release. Adds the shared SELinux label (`z`) to the `graphiti-mcp`
config bind mount in `infrastructure/docker-compose.yml` so the MCP
server starts cleanly on Fedora/RHEL hosts with SELinux enforcing.

### Fixed

- **graphiti-mcp crash on SELinux-enforcing hosts** — the host bind
  mount of `config.yaml` into the `zepai/knowledge-graph-mcp` container
  was declared `:ro` only. The host file lives under `/home/...` and
  carries the `user_home_t` SELinux label, so the container process was
  denied `stat()` and the MCP server crashed with
  `PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied:
  '/app/mcp/config/config.yaml'`. Adding the `z` relabel brings the
  mount into line with every other bind mount in the file (memgraph,
  clickhouse, otel collector) and unblocks the container without
  changing read-only semantics. SELinux-disabled hosts are unaffected
  (`z` is a no-op there).

### Notes

- Same-day patch release against `0.2.1`. No manifest schema, skill, or
  hook behaviour change.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-25

Adds a `SessionStart` hook that injects the bundled `references/harness5.md`
operating instructions into every Codex and Claude Code session.

### Added

- **SessionStart hook** — `plugins/harness5/hooks/hooks.json` (Codex,
  auto-discovered) and `plugins/harness5/hooks/claude/hooks.json` (Claude
  Code, declared via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Both wire to the same
  shared loader at `plugins/harness5/hooks/loader.py`.
- **Bundled instructions file** —
  `plugins/harness5/hooks/references/harness5.md`. Carries the harness5
  operating instructions verbatim so every Codex/Claude Code session with
  harness5 installed starts with them loaded.
- **Loader script** — `plugins/harness5/hooks/loader.py` (Python 3 stdlib
  only, `+x`). Emits the canonical
  `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "SessionStart", "additionalContext": ...}}`
  shape that both harnesses consume identically.
- **Plugin self-check** — `plugins/harness5/hooks/validate.py` (six
  checks: manifest version, manifest hooks field, hooks files present,
  hooks JSON valid, loader executable, bundled markdown present) plus
  `test_loader.py` and `test_validate.py` (`unittest`, 21 tests total).

### Loader contract

- **Failure mode**: missing or unreadable `harness5.md` → no JSON on
  stdout, single-line warning on stderr, exit 0. The hook never blocks
  a session.
- **Size cap**: soft warning on stderr when `harness5.md` exceeds 32,768
  characters, but the file is still injected without truncation.

### Notes

- The repo-root `CLAUDE.md` was removed in slice #10 so the
  hook becomes the sole source of truth and there is no window where a
  user's CLAUDE.md auto-load and the hook injection disagree (pre-0.2.2).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-25

Relocated the plugin from repo-root-native manifests into `plugins/harness5/`,
sibling with `plugins/auto-review/`. The repo is now a multi-plugin
distribution repo rather than a personal `~/.claude` config.

### Changed

- **Layout** — `skills/` and `infrastructure/` moved into
  `plugins/harness5/`. The `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifests moved alongside them. The plugin is
  now fully self-contained under `plugins/harness5/`, matching the
  `plugins/auto-review/` pattern.
- **Manifests** — descriptions updated to drop the "single installable
  plugin" framing and the personal-`~/.claude` references; version bumped to
  0.2.0. The `"skills"` path fields still resolve relative to the plugin
  dir (`./skills/`), so no install-side change is required.
- **Marketplaces** — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and
  `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` now list both `harness5` and
  `auto-review`, each with `source` pointing at its `plugins/<name>/`
  subfolder.
- **ADR 0007** supersedes ADR 0005's "root-native manifests, one plugin"
  decision for the multi-plugin layout.

### Notes

- `harness5-init` is unaffected: it resolves the plugin root from
  `PLUGIN_ROOT` / `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, so the path-depth change is absorbed
  automatically. The bare `infrastructure/...` paths inside skills still
  resolve correctly because an installed plugin's root is its own dir.
- The repo no longer ships `settings.json`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `scripts/`,
  or `docs/` as part of any plugin; those remain at repo root as
  development-only content.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-19

Initial release as a root-native plugin (per ADR 0005). See
`docs/adr/0005-harness5-plugin-distribution.md` for the original decision and
measured results.
